# Unity3D Basics: Step into VR development

This tutorial will help you familiarize yourself with the Unity3D environment and should prepare you for creating a simple VR game/experience. Starting with the absolute basics, youâ€™ll learn how to navigate Unity3D and create game objects. As the tutorial progresses, we will design a simple first-person PC video game that can be played using your mouse and keyboard. In the final chapter you will learn how to utilize OpenXR to move the game into Virtual Reality.

The tutorial is designed for the CS/PSY 484 Virtual Reality course at the University of Nevada - Reno.

## Requirements
This is a step-by-step tutorial with no previous coding or Unity3D experience needed.

You will need a PC or laptop with Windows or MacOS operating system. Unity3D is a heavy software, so it is recommended to use a more powerful device if possible. Modern Macbooks (2020 and newer) are very well optimized for Unity development but for Windows-based devices I recommend at least 8GB of RAM and fast SSD drive.
