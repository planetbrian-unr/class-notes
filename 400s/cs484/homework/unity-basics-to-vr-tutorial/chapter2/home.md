# Chapter 1 - First Video Game
In this chapter we will create a simple coin collection game using a first person controller from previous part. It is still step-by-step based, however you are expected to understand elements explained in previous chapter.

We will write simple C# scripts, however every part of the code will be explained and ready to copy and paste.
